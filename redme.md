# Object-Oriented Programming 
* programming style that is centered around object rather then function
* combine a group of related wariable and function into a unit 

# Encapsulation 
Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not accessible from outside that class.

This will keep code that's outside the class from accidentally manipulating internal methods and properties.

# Abstraction 
Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.

# Inheritance
Inheritance makes all properties and methods available to a child class. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.

# Polymorphism
having different and many forms 
* overwriting a method inherit from a parent class 

#  What is Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript?
* Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that governs how objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. 

* prototypal inheritance in JavaScript allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects through a chain of prototypes, making it a fundamental mechanism for creating and sharing functionality in the language.

# ES6 Classes in JavaScript 
create an object of a class, a constructor is invoked first. If there is no constructor, the default constructor is invoked which does nothing.

* Classes are not hoisted 
* Classes are first-class citizens (If a programming language has the ability to pass a function as an argument – to treat functions as values and to return functions – it is said that the language has first-class functions and those function are called first-class citizens)
* Classes are executed in strict mode.
