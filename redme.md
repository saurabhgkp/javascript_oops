# Object-Oriented Programming 
* programming style that is centered around object rather then function
* combine a group of related wariable and function into a unit 

# Encapsulation 
Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not accessible from outside that class.

This will keep code that's outside the class from accidentally manipulating internal methods and properties.

# Abstraction 
Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential features or functions.

# Inheritance
Inheritance makes all properties and methods available to a child class. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.

# Polymorphism
having different and many forms 
* overwriting a method inherit from a parent class
